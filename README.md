# EDITING THE DOCUMENT
First, you need to do the following 1 time only:

1. Go to a command line, and go to the directory where you want this folder to be
2. Type "git clone https://github.com/DavisTrey/fiveguysfacts.git"
3. now type "cd fiveguysfacts"

Now you can edit the .docx file. When you are ready to commit your changes (commit in small increments, and commit as soon as you make changes, or else you will be unhappy):

1. Go back to the command line (make sure you are in the five guys facts folder)
2. Type "git pull" just to make sure you are up to date
3. Type "git status"
4. You should see FiveGuysFacts.docx in red (indicating changes have been made). If you don't see this, you fucked up somehow. 
5. Type "git add *". This adds the file to your running changelist
6. Type "git commit -m "some message about your change"". Replace my part in quotes with a real message (but note you do need to type those quotes). This commits your change locally with the comment you type. 
7. Type "git push origin master" - you should see a success prompt.  (NOTE - BEFORE YOU DO THIS GO THROUGH THE "Validating you didn't fuck anything up" section below)

Yay! Now, if you want to make more changes in the future, just restart from the beginning of the second set of instructions. 

# FORMATTING
## Text Size
Use font size 20 for headers (title of each fact). Use size 16 for sub-headings within a fact. Use size 12 for all regular text. 

## Bolding
Bold the title of each fact, and each sub-heading in a fact

## Bookmarks
Make the title of each fact a bookmark. Highlight the text, go to insert, and then select bookmark. Name the bookmark the same thing as the title of the fact.

Once you do this, go to the table of contents, add a new entry in the appropriate spot for the new fact. Then, select the entry (which should be titled the same as the name of the fact), click insert, and then select hyperlink. From the hyperlink menu, select "in this document", then select the bookmark you made. 

## Footnotes
If you want to add a footnote, put your cursor where you want the icon to show up. Then, select insert -> footnote. Click "Apply" (don't fuck with these settings), and then type the footnote text. 

## Inserting Text
It will be common to copy-paste text from medium. When you do this, after pasting, click the paste-select menu, and then select "text only". This ensures that your copy does not include and fucked formatting from Medium. 

## Inserting Images
DO NOT EVER COPY PASTE AN IMAGE IN. You must download each image you want to include, and then go to insert -> image in the word menu. Make sure every image is centered on the screen. 

I repeat - DO NOT COPY PASTE AN IMAGE. 

# Validating that you didn't fuck anything up
I reccomend going to the kindle direct publishing website (https://kdp.amazon.com/), sign in, go to bookshelf, click the +book button, and then go to the second page where you can upload and preview a manuscript. 

Upload our docx file, then click "Preview". Look at all the new sections you added and make sure they look good, that your links work, etc. You should go through the following checklist: 

    1. Did I add a table of contents entry and a link from that entry to my fact
    2. Does my fact look good? Are there any formatting errors? Did images get uploaded and displayed properly?
    3. Do all my footnotes work? Click each to make sure they work properly (Clicking the foonote should deep link you to the footnote description, and then clicking the footnote link from the foot note should link you back).
